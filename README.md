###Buiness Goals

4. increase bookings

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

## UX

###Strategy

A site designed for patients both new and existing to obatin information about the clinics services and therapists.
It also a place where patients can see whats on offer and hear customer reviews and make further enquiries or bookings. 


###Scope

For patients, I wanted to provide them with easy accesible links to information they required about the clinic. 

###Structure

###Skeleton

###Surface
The minamilist colour scheme was to create a clean clinical feel that coincides with a medical practice. 

## Features


1. Existing Features


2. Features Left to Implement

I think a great feature to add would be a direct online booking system to the website. 
This would allow clients to see available time slots and be able to select the desired therapist or service.
It would facilitate a quick and easy bookling process. 

## Technologies Used
1. CSS
2. HTML
3. BootStrap
4. Balsamiq wireframes
5. Fontawesome
6. Google Font
7. Gitpod
8. Shuttershock
9. w3schools.com
10. HTML Formater 

## Testing

All social links were created using the "target=_blank" attribute in footer to ensure the pages are laoded on a seperate page.
The have been linked with the homepages for Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin and Instagram as it is a fictional website and no linked accounts exist.  
They have all been manually tested to ensure correct naviagtion of the links.

On the contact us page, the Name, email address, contact number and text area are all required fields and will not submit otherwise.
The email input must contain a valid email address and numbers are only accepted in the email section.

The iframe succesfully naviagates to the google maps link of the location of the clinc.

the link for more information on the Alter G also successfully navigates the user to the Alter G homepage.
