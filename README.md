# Alison Clarke - Mile Stone Project One
# Sports Injury Clinic Website

A comprehensive website designed to make it easy for existing clients and potential new clients to attain valuable information about the buisness and its services. 
The website includes information about the services provided in the clinic, the skills and qualifications of the staff, testimonials from past clients, contact information and links on where to find the clinic. 

The website needs supply as much information as possible about the services and qualifications to encourage a potential client to get in contact.
The customer needs to feel confident that this business can provide the service that they are looking for.


### Buiness Goals
1. Create some clinic awareness and a place for customers to find some instant information.
2. Customers to learn about therapists and services provided.
3. Encourage a point of contact for potential appointment.
4. Increase bookings.

### Customer Goals
1. Find information out information about services (What do they provide?)
2. Where can I find them? 
3. Reviews and ratings
4. Social media links
5. Getting the practical information


## UX

### Strategy

A site designed for patients both new and existing to obatin information about the clinics services and therapists.
It's also a place where patients can see whats on offer and hear customer reviews and make further enquiries or bookings. 
Essentially an online calling card for the clinic.

### Scope

For patients, I wanted to provide them with features to easy accesible links to information they required about the clinic.
Provide information about each therapist, each service that is provided, location, openning hours and how to make an appointment.
In essence, providing the practical information that is required by the customer. 

### Structure

The information should be structured in a user friendly way and logically grouped. All services are grouped together, all information about the therapists in a seperate section, and all methods of contact grouped together.
Structured in a way that leads from the user seeing all the services and information provided to finish with an option to book now or make contact. 

### Skeleton
Good interface and Navigation design. Navigation bar is common and conventional to allow for ease of use. 
The header and footer are the same across the site.
Content is positioned centrally in an easy to read format. 
The Nav bar collapses to hamburger button on mobile device which is also a common tool used and will allow for easy naviagtion on mobile device.
Balsamiq wireframes were used to design rough outlines of what the site would look like.

### Surface
The minamilist colour scheme was to create a clean and clinical feel that coincides with a medical practice. This minimizes cognitive overload.

## Features


1. Existing Features

* The clinic name and logo remain consistant amoung all pages for familiarity.
* The footer also remains consisent across pages and contains contact information and external links to socail media. 
* A responsive Navigation bar that allows the user to easily browse throughtout the site either on mobile or desktop. The active page is also highlighted while in use for greater user experience.
* Each page has a Book Me button that brings the user to the contact page to encourage interation with the clinic.
* The home page has a large hero image to give maximum impact when landing on the page. 
* There are some testimoanls in the home page from previous clients that encourage user satisfaction with the clinic.

2. Features Left to Implement

* I think a great feature to add would be a direct online booking system to the website. 
This would allow clients to see available time slots and be able to select the desired therapist or service.
It would facilitate a quick and easy booking process. 

## Technologies Used
1. CSS programming language
2. HTML programming language
3. [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* To create a responsive structure for the website. 
4. [Balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/)
* used to create mock ups of what the site will look like
5. [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* To create icons for the website
6. [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/)
* Was used to style the fonts used in the website
7. [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/)
* To build and develop code
8. [w3schools](w3schools.com)
* To help with formatting and styles.
9. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
* The forums were useful for styling issues.
10. [HTML Formater](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html#ad-output)
* To beatify HTML code
11. [W3C validator Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
* To validate HTML code
12. [W3C CSS validator service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)
* To validate CSS code

## Testing

The responsive navigation bar successfully becomes a hamburger menu on mobile device and the dropdown menu acts correctly to navigate throughout the site. 

All social links were created using the "target=_blank" attribute in footer to ensure the pages are laoded on a seperate page.
The have been linked with the homepages for Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin and Instagram as it is a fictional website and no linked accounts exist.  
They have all been manually tested to ensure correct naviagtion of the links.

On the contact us page, the Name, email address, contact number and text area are all required fields and will not submit otherwise.
The email input must contain a valid email address and numbers are only accepted in the email section.

The Book Me button succesfully re directs users to contact page. 

By clicking the logo the user is also successfully redirected back to the home page.

The iframe succesfully naviagates to the google maps link of the location of the clinc.

The link for more information on the Alter G also successfully navigates the user to the Alter G homepage in a seperate tab.

The website is responsive on different size screens and elements respond appropriately across the different screen sizes. One problem that arised from this was the navbar toggler automatically floated left. Margin-left: auto had to be added to CSS in order to float the toggler which is a much more common position.  

The project was also tested on multuple browsers (chrome, microsft edge, internet explorer, and firefox) to ensure compatability and responsiveness. 

The HTML was checked using the [W3C validator Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)

The CSS was checked using the [W3C CSS validator service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)

## Deployment
A repository was created on GitHub and Gitpod was used to write the code. The code was commited and pushed to Github regularly to ensure it was saved.
The GitHub repository was then deployed to GitHub pages by:
1. Logging into GitHub
2. Selecting repositories and then Milestone_1
3. Then select settings from the top menu bar.
4. Under GitHub pages
5. Under source, select master branch.
6. The website is now deployed and a link appears for the deployed site.
7. This link can now be cloned and run locally.
