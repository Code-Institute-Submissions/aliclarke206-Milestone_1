The website includes information about the services provided in the clinic, the skills and qualifications of the staff, contact information and links on where to find the clinic. 


### Buiness Goals

4. increase bookings 

### Customer Goals
1. Find information on services (What do they provide?)
2. Where can I find them? 
3. Reviews and ratings

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

## UX

### Strategy

A site designed for patients both new and existing to obatin information about the clinics services and therapists.
It also a place where patients can see whats on offer and hear customer reviews and make further enquiries or bookings. 


### Scope

For patients, I wanted to provide them with easy accesible links to information they required about the clinic.
Provide information about each therapist, each service that is provided, location, openning hours and how to make an appointment.
Providing the practical information that is required by the customer. 

### Structure

### Skeleton
Good interface and Navigation design. Navigation is common and conventional to allow for ease of use. 
The header and footer are the same across the site.
Balsamiq wireframes were used to design rough outlines of what the site would look like.

[Home page](https://github.com/aliclarke206/Milestone_1/blob/b6243fabbf2882f512bd825280447cdb6004b736/wireframes/about-us.png)

### Surface
The minamilist colour scheme was to create a clean clinical feel that coincides with a medical practice. Minimizing cognative overload.

## Features


1. Existing Features

Each page has a Book Me button that brings the user to the contact page to encourage interation with the clinic.
There is an iframe element that brings the user to the exact loction of the clinic which is compatable with their google maps.



2. Features Left to Implement

I think a great feature to add would be a direct online booking system to the website. 
This would allow clients to see available time slots and be able to select the desired therapist or service.
It would facilitate a quick and easy bookling process.

## Testing

All social links were created using the "target=_blank" attribute in footer to ensure the pages are laoded on a seperate page.
The have been linked with the homepages for Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin and Instagram as it is a fictional website and no linked accounts exist.  
They have all been manually tested to ensure correct naviagtion of the links.

On the contact us page, the Name, email address, contact number and text area are all required fields and will not submit otherwise.
The email input must contain a valid email address and numbers are only accepted in the email section.

The iframe succesfully naviagates to the google maps link of the location of the clinc.

the link for more information on the Alter G also successfully navigates the user to the Alter G homepage.
